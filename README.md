# Vibraniom
Vibraniom is a decentralized music platform built on the Monad blockchain, empowering artists to upload and monetize their music as NFTs. Artists can release singles with cover images, create albums with multiple tracks, or build albums over time without a fixed release dateâ€”all deciding on release dates where applicable.
